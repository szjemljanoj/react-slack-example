Slack client app done with node.js, react & webrender (using [node-webrender](https://github.com/cztomsik/node-webrender))

- Do not use this for work
- mind it's just an example and so it's far from being feature complete (it's barely working)
- you can't even select different channel (but it's not that much extra-work)
- any help is welcome
- windows is not yet supported

run with

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
